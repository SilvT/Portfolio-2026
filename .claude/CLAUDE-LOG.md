# Claude Log - Portfolio 2025

## 2026-01-22

### Project Status
Portfolio website is functional with:
- Landing page with flip-board animation, scroll snap navigation
- Case study page (marketing-management.html) with carousels, accordions, side nav
- GLightbox for image galleries (migrated from lightGallery)
- Footer icon animation recently added

### Recent Changes (from git history)
- `e6cda77` - Footer icon animation added
- `59ab575` - Metric cards carousel order fixed
- `904d293` - Lightbox migration to GLightbox
- `1f3ed0e` - SCSS cleanup and restructuring
- `a7d8d84` - Side nav bar fixes for case studies

### Key Decisions
- Using vanilla JS (no framework) for minimal footprint
- GLightbox chosen over lightGallery for lightbox functionality
- CSS scroll snap for section navigation
- Modular SCSS architecture with separate files per component
